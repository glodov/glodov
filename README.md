# Hello, my dear reader! 🙌

## About

Here is a bit of information about myself in this marvelous life. ❤️  
There is no stop in observing the universe, it is a continuous and infinite process.  

My current position is as a Solution Architect and Business Developer. 💻  
Everything is about data (objects) and processes (flows) and this is what has to be planned, organized, controlled, and led.  

Building solutions in the chaotic world is my passion. 🧑‍🦰  

Learning from the best teachers in the world and becoming a better person every day. ☀️  

Wish you follow your mission and be a better person of yourself every day 🙏  

📔 My favorite writer is Red Bradbury, but my favorite books are "Cuckoo Nest" by Ken Kesey and "Atlas Shrugged" by Ayn Rand.
