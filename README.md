# Hello, my dear reader! 🙌

## About me

Here is a bit of information about me in this marvellous life. ❤️  
There is no stop in observing the universe, it is a continuous and infinite process.  

My current position is as a Social and Solution Architect, author of poems and lectures, human rights activist.  


### Political views
Anarchist

> The government cannot give people more than it takes.

There is no need to manage sovereign people. They can manage themselves.

### Mission

Building solutions in the chaotic world is my passion and the only way to live in harmony in this world. 🧑‍🦰  
The most crucial solution I discovered and implemented every moment is being truthful with me (myself), and being an authentic soul self.  

Learning from the best teachers in the world and becoming a better person every day. ☀️  

Wish you follow your mission and be a better person of yourself every day 🙏
